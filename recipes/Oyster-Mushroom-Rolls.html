            <h1>Oyster Mushroom Rice Paper Rolls w/ Fresh Chilli Oil</h1>
            <p>These rice paper rolls with oyster mushrooms and lettuce have become a bit of a signature snack every time I have people over. It actually started quite casually. One evening, I had my OGSG over for dinner, and I wanted to make rice paper rolls but didn’t really plan ahead. I checked my fridge and all I had was a bunch of oyster mushrooms and some lettuce. So I thought, why not just put these two together and see how it turns out? And that’s how this version of rice paper rolls was born.</p>
            <p>A little while later, we had a colour-themed picnic on the amphi lawns, and my colour was green. I had to make something green-ish, so I made these rolls again, and they were such a hit with my friends. Ever since then, these rolls have become a constant. Whether it’s a house gathering or even when I want a quick, fresh snack for myself, this is my go-to. They barely take 10–15 minutes to put together, and you end up with a snack that’s light and genuinely tasty.</p>
            <p>What I love the most about these rolls is how simple they are, yet how much texture and flavour they pack. The umami flavour of the mushrooms, paired with that subtle tang from the rice wine vinegar, the crunch from the lettuce, and the soft, chewy texture that comes from the rice paper — it all comes together in the best possible way. So many layers of texture and taste, yet so effortless.</p>

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <h4>1. Make the Chilli Oil</h4>
                <p>In a heat-proof bowl, add chopped chillies, garlic, spring onion greens, pepper, salt, and sesame seeds.</p>
                <p>Heat oil in a small pan until hot but not smoking. Carefully pour it over the chilli-garlic mixture. Let it cool completely.</p>

                <h4>2. Cook the Mushrooms</h4>
                <p>Tear the oyster mushrooms into strips. Wash and squeeze out all excess water.</p>
                <p>Heat olive oil in a pan and sauté the mushrooms until browned on both sides, pressing them for a good roast.</p>
                <p>Turn up the heat slightly, add rice wine vinegar, soy sauce, and a sprinkle of salt. Toss well. Set aside.</p>

                <h4>3. Prep the Lettuce</h4>
                <p>Wash, dry, and tear lettuce into bite-sized pieces.</p>
                <p>Season with salt, black pepper, and a drizzle of Tabasco. Toss lightly. (Add salt at the end so lettuce stays crisp.)</p>

                <h4>4. Assemble the Rolls</h4>
                <p>Dip a rice paper sheet in water for 10–15 seconds until soft. Place on a flat surface.</p>
                <p>Add lettuce and 2–3 mushroom pieces to the center. Fold the sides in and roll tightly from bottom to top like a burrito.</p>

                <h4>5. Serve</h4>
                <p>Serve fresh with a side of your homemade chilli oil for dipping.</p>
                <p>You can also drizzle a bit of the chilli oil inside before wrapping for extra heat.</p>
