            <h1>Mutton Meatball Sub</h1>
            <p>While it was originally intended to be served to folks during a film screening of <em>Welcome</em> in the Amphitheatre, due to a last-minute rescheduling we had to give those away in my quad itself.  
            It was the last mass cooking scene I did in my quad and it was quite a bittersweet affair. The sub was great though.</p>

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <h4>Marinara Sauce</h4>
                <p>1. Cook crushed garlic and chilli flakes in olive oil until the garlic turns golden.</p>
                <p>2. Add chopped onions and sauté until translucent.</p>
                <p>3. Add crushed San Marzano tomatoes and salt. Let it cook until it thickens. Add water and slow cook the sauce.</p>
                <p>4. Once bubbling, stir in a pinch of baking powder to cut the acidity.</p>
                <p>5. Add oregano and adjust salt if needed.</p>
                <p>6. Chiffonade the basil leaves and stir them into the sauce.</p>

                <h4>Assembling the Meatball Sub</h4>
                <p>1. Shallow fry the meatballs in olive oil until cooked and golden.</p>
                <p>2. Slit a baguette in half (keeping one end intact) and toast the inside with butter until golden.</p>
                <p>3. Layer smoked cheddar on the toasted bread, then add American cheese slices and place the meatballs over them.</p>
                <p>4. Pour hot marinara sauce over the meatballs.</p>
                <p>5. Grate Parmesan cheese on top and garnish with more chiffonade basil.</p>
                <p>6. Close that baby up and enjoy the comforting, cheesy, meaty goodness!</p>
