            <h1>Bougie Milk Maggi</h1>
            <p>If maggi is like a warm hug to you, this recipe makes the hug a cozy cuddle. I have been making this dish since the pandemic and it is a lesser-known delicacy in Manipal, which is where I got introduced to it. This dish was my go-to low-cost indulgence meal that I could make after a long arduous day at ISB. Consider this dish to be the love child of Mac n' cheese and Maggi.</p>

                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 packet Maggi Noodles (plain ol' maggi noodles)</li>
                    <li>1/2 packet Maggi's Magic Masala</li>
                    <li>100 mL Milk</li>
                    <li>100 ML Water</li>
                    <li>Dried Italian Seasoning</li>
                    <li>Chilli Flakes</li>
                    <li>Pepper</li>
                    <li>Turmeric</li>
                    <li>Salt</li>
                    <li>Rasam Powder</li>
                    <li>Garam Masala Powder</li>
                    <li>1 knob of Amul Garlic Butter</li>
                    <li>Fresh Cilantro</li>
                    <li>Fresh Basil Leaves</li>
                    <li>Chilli Crisps (or Maggi hot n' sweet tomato chilli sauce)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="steps">
                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <p>1. In a saucepan, add all the dry spices (maggi's packet masala, magic masala, turmeric, chilli flakes, pepper, italian seasoning, rasam powder, garam masala, salt) to your taste.</p>
                <p>2. Add in milk and water to this mixture and stir it in so that no lumps are formed.</p>
                <p>3. Now switch the heat on and add in your Maggi noodles, breaking it apart if you'd like.</p>
                <p>4. Cook it usually the way you cook maggi. Use low to medium heat and ensure you stir frequently. This way no milk residue gets burnt or sticks to the bottom of the pan.</p>
                <p>5. Once the maggi is cooked, switch the heat off and add in the knob of Amul garlic butter, freshly cut cilantro and basil leaves. You want this maggi to be a little saucy.</p>
                <p>6. Serve this in a bowl topped with chilli crisps or maggi hot n' sweet tomato chilli sauce. Trust me, your mind is going to be blown, and you would be spoilt forever, regardless of how much of a maggi purist you may be &lt;3</p>
                <p><em>Note: This particular combination of masale has provided the best satisfaction to me :)</em></p>
                <p><em>Feel free to experiment with the masala and the type of milk you use - even coconut milk was an interesting choice. Add cheese in if you want to make it more indulgent but this dish is already going to be fairly creamy :) Enjoy this only when it's hot.</em></p>
