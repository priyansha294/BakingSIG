            <h1>Sangria</h1>
            <p>This is the first drink I made as a part of the Finer Things Club (naming credits to Tushar Bhatia). What is the Finer Things Club, you ask? It‚Äôs a group of 4 people and our friends who bonded over a love for cooking and eating good food. This is a set of people I'll cherish forever ‚Äî and this sangria, while a small part of a very big day, was my contribution to our first group gathering.</p>
