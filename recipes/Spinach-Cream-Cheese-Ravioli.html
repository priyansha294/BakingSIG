                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1/2 cup All-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup Semolina/Sooji</li>
                    <li>200 grams Spinach</li>
                    <li>80 grams Cream Cheese</li>
                    <li>Garlic Butter</li>
                    <li>Salt</li>
                    <li>Water</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="steps">
                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <p>1. Mix equal parts all-purpose flour (maida) and semolina (sooji) with a pinch of salt and knead a soft dough using slightly warm water. If your dough is too dry, add a tablespoon of water. If it's too wet and sticky, add a bit of maida. Wrap it in cling film and let it rest while you make the filling.</p>
                <p>2. Wash and remove stems from the spinach and chop it roughly. Sauté the spinach in garlic butter and a pinch of salt until it releases water. Let it cool and mix in the cream cheese.</p>
                <p>3. Roll out the dough into thin sheets and cut out squares. Place the filling in the centre of each square sheet and cover with another square sheet, sealing the edges with water. You can experiment with ravioli shapes.</p>
                <p>4. Bring a large pan of salted water to boil and add the ravioli. Let them cook for 4–5 minutes until they float to the top. Add the cooked ravioli to a sauce of your preference.</p>

                <h4>Aglio e Olio Sauce</h4>
                <p>Melt butter in a pan and add a bit of olive oil to prevent it from browning. Add garlic and chilli flakes to the melted butter, along with some pasta water.</p>

                <h4>Cherry Tomato Sauce</h4>
                <p>Melt butter in a pan and add cherry tomatoes. Cook until the tomatoes become mushy. Add your seasonings (salt, chilli flakes, oregano) and a splash of pasta water. Top with fresh basil leaves.</p>
