            <h1>Munakkada Pappu-charu</h1>
            <p>I had hosted a South Indian festive lunch for Sankranthi at my studio, and one dish that completely stole the show was munakkada pappu-charu. It stood out for two simple reasons.</p>
            <p>First, the curiosity. People from Andhra or Telangana instantly knew what it was. But many others, especially friends from up North and different parts of India, were clueless. Some asked if it was dal, some thought it was rasam, others wondered if it was a kind of sambar. And that was the best part. It was neither, but somewhere in between — lighter, tangier and in my opinion, better than all three. What makes pappu-charu special is that it doesn’t use sambar powder, and usually has just one vegetable in it — like drumstick, radish or onion.</p>
            <p>Second, the taste. Like most great Indian dishes, it may not look fancy but the flavour is unreal. The real game-changer here is tamarind. A lot of people at lunch mentioned how the onions tasted so different from how they do in sambar or dal — and that’s because, in pappu-charu, the onions and drumsticks are cooked soft in tamarind water itself. That tiny detail changes everything.</p>
            <p>For these two reasons — the curiosity it sparked and the punch of flavour — munakkada (drumstick) pappu-charu became the unexpected hero of the lunch. And honestly, it deserved every bit of the attention.</p>

                    <li>1 medium onion, thinly sliced</li>
                    <li>3 tsp tamarind paste (add 1 extra tsp if you like it super tangy)</li>
                    <li>Salt to taste</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>For Tempering (Tadka)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 tbsp oil</li>

                    <li>½ tsp mustard seeds</li>
                    <li>½ tsp cumin seeds</li>
                    <li>5–6 green chilies, slit</li>
                    <li>5–6 garlic cloves, crushed</li>

            <div class="steps">
                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <h4>Cook the vegetables:</h4>
                <p>1. In a pot, mix 1 cup water with tamarind paste and salt.</p>
                <p>2. Add sliced onions and drumstick pieces.</p>
                <p>3. Boil until drumsticks and onions turn soft.</p>

                <h4>Add dal:</h4>
                <p>4. Add the pressure-cooked and mashed toor dal.</p>
                <p>5. Adjust salt and water to achieve a slightly thin consistency — somewhere between sambar and rasam.</p>
                <p>6. Simmer on low flame for 5–10 minutes to bring everything together.</p>

                <h4>Prepare the tempering (tadka):</h4>
                <p>7. In a small pan, heat oil and ghee.</p>
                <p>8. Add mustard seeds and let them splutter.</p>
                <p>9. Add cumin seeds, green chilies, crushed garlic, and hing.</p>
                <p>10. Sauté until the garlic turns light golden and aromatic.</p>

                <h4>Finish:</h4>
                <p>11. Turn off the stove and pour the hot tempering over the dal in the pot.</p>
                <p>12. Do not mix immediately — cover the pot with a lid to trap the steam and aroma.</p>
                <p>13. Let it sit for 5–7 minutes.</p>
                <p>14. Open, mix well, and serve hot with steamed rice.</p>
